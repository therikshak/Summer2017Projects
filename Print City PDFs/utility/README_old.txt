Instructions for Using the PDF Script
	-It is recomended that you only have 1 instance of VBS running as the script
	has not been tested with multiple instances open

	-The keyboard and mouse should not be used while the script is running with the 
	 only exceptions being when the script prompts you for information (will prompt
	 3 times throughout the program)

	-To kill the script at anytime, press windows key + z

1. Open up VBS, login and then minimize the screen

2. Double click on "Print_Orders_To_PDF" to launch the script

3. The program will first ask you to enter which plant you want to print orders from.
   Type the corresponding number and press enter. The program will then launch a new 
   instance of VBS and navigate to the orders page.

4. After a second the script will prompt you for the start date to see orders from.
   Enter the date in mm/dd/yy or mm/dd/yyyy format

5. After a few more seconds the program will ask you to enter the end date for orders
   to pull. Enter the date in the same format as above.

6. The script will paste the website page data into an excel sheet to copy the order 
   numbers from, and then begin switching back and forth printing orders and copying
   order numbers. When the script is finished, a message box saying "Complete" will 
   pop up.
